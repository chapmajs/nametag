LED Nametag
-----------

PIC-based LED nametags for conferences and such. V1 is based on a PIC16F88 and DL2416 smart displays.

### Version 1

V1 was put together on short notice for [The Eleventh HOPE](https://hope.net) due to running out of time to build the nametag I'd been meaning to build. It uses a [PIC16F88](https://github.com/chapmajs/nametag/blob/master/datasheets/PIC16F88.pdf) because I had a few in my parts drawers from previous projects. [DL2416 smart displays](https://github.com/chapmajs/nametag/blob/master/datasheets/DL2416.pdf) were used to avoid having to wire up multiplex hardware on perfboard and keep the nametag small.
